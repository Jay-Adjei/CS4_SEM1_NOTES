# Fibre Optics

## Detailed Notes

#### Advantages of Fibre Optics
- Speed
- Distance 
- Complete potential separation 
- Immunity against overvoltages
- Maximum interference resistance
- No crosstalk

#### Structure  of an optical Fibre.

#### Some common connectors
- SC connector
- LC connector
- FC connector
- ST connector

#### Transmission
- [[Full duplex]]
- [[Half duplex]]

#### Single mode/ Multi-mode fibre.
Both the cores and cladding have different dimensions.

| Single Mode                            | Multi-mode                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Bandwidth is infinite.                 | Bandwidth ranges from 0-10GB.        |
| Can travel 100km before amplification. | Can travel 3km before amplification. |
| Best option for upgrade                | Worst for upgrade                    |


## Questions
- What capacity do you want to transmit?
- What is the maximum distance between two points?
- Do you have any future upgrades plans?

## Key Points
- Atenuation: the loss of signal over distance.
- Splicing: the process of joining fibre optic cores.
