-A software process model is a simplified representation of a software process.

## Key Points

-Critical Systems -> require a very structured development process.
-Business Systems -> require a less formal, flexible process in order to be effective.

-Software processes can be improved by process standardization where the diversity in software processes across an organization is reduced.
