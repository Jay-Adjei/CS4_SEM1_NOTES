# Software Process

## Detailed Notes

-A **software process** is set of related activities that leads to the production of a software product.
-Activities that are fundamental to software engineering:
- **Software Specification**: The functionality and constraints of the software must be defined.
- **Software design and implementation**: The software to meet the specification must be developed/produced.
- **Software Validation**: The software must be validated ensure  that it does what the customer wants.
- **Software Evolution**: The software must evolve to meet changing customer needs.
-Software Process are Categorized as:
- **Plan-driven** process: a process where by all the processes are planned in advance and progress is measured against the plan.
- **Agile** process: planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect the changing customer requirements.

### Software Process Model
-A software process model is a simplified representation of a software process.
-Each [[process model]] represents a process from a particular perspective, and thus provides only partial information about that process. For example, a process activity model shows the activities and their sequence but may not show the roles of the people involved in these activities.
- [[The waterfall model]]: This takes the fundamental process activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution and represents them as separate process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implementation, testing, and so on.
- [[Incremental development]]: This approach interleaves the activities of specification, development, and validation. The system is developed as a series of versions (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous version.
- [[Reuse-oriented software engineering]]: This approach is based on the existence of a significant number of reusable components. The system development process focuses on integrating these components into a system rather than developing them from scratch.

## Key Points

-Critical Systems -> require a very structured development process.
-Business Systems -> require a less formal, flexible process in order to be effective.

-Software processes can be improved by process standardization where the diversity in software processes across an organization is reduced.
-General process models can also be called process paradigms
