# Operating System Structures

## Detailed Notes
### **Operating Systems Services**
1. **Purpose of Operating Systems**

- Provides an environment for executing programs.
- Offers services to both programs and their users.

2. **Types of Operating System Services**

- **User-Oriented Services:** Functions designed to assist users, improving their experience.
- **System-Oriented Services:** Functions that ensure efficient system operation through resource sharing.

**Final Takeaways**  
✔ Operating systems create a platform for running programs.  
✔ They offer services to both programs and users.  
✔ Services are divided into user-helpful functions and system-efficiency functions.

### **OS Services Helpful to the User**
1. **User Interface (UI)**

- Allows users to interact with the system, available in several forms:
    - **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Uses text commands input via keyboard.
    - **Graphics User Interface (GUI):** Window-based system with pointing devices and menus.
    - **Batch Interface:** Executes commands stored in files.

2. **Program Execution**

- Loads programs into memory, runs them, and handles termination, detecting errors if they occur.

3. **I/O Operations**

- Supports input/output functions, which can involve files or devices.

4. **File-System Manipulation**

- Programs can read, write, create, delete, search, and manage file permissions in directories.

5. **Communications**

- Processes exchange information locally or over a network via shared memory or message passing (handled by the OS).

6. **Error Detection**

- The OS monitors and handles errors in hardware (CPU, memory, I/O devices) and software (user programs).
- It takes corrective actions for different error types and provides debugging tools for users and programmers.

**Final Takeaways**  
✔ OS provides different interfaces for user interaction (CLI, GUI, Batch).  
✔ It enables program execution and error handling.  
✔ Manages input/output operations required by running programs.
✔ OS manages file reading, writing, and permissions.  
✔ Enables process communication through shared memory or message passing.  
✔ Detects and handles hardware and software errors, ensuring system stability and offering debugging tools.

### **OS for Ensuring Efficient Operation**
1. **Resource Allocation**

- Distributes resources (CPU cycles, memory, file storage, I/O devices) among users and processes running concurrently.

2. **Accounting**

- Tracks resource usage by different users and processes.

3. **Protection and Security**

- **Protection:** Controls access to system resources, preventing interference between processes.
- **Security:** Requires user authentication and defends against unauthorized access to system resources and I/O devices.

**Final Takeaways**  
✔ OS allocates resources for concurrent tasks.  
✔ Tracks usage for system management and billing.  
✔ Ensures system security through controlled access and user authentication.
