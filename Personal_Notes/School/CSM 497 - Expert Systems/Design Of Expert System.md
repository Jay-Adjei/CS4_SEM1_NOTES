# Design Of Expert System

## üìöDetailed Notes

# üìò Chapter 6: Practical Development of Expert Systems

---

## üîπ 6.1 Introduction

- This chapter shifts from theory to **real-world expert system development**.
    
- Uses **software engineering methodologies** to ensure systems are **cost-effective**, **timely**, and **maintainable**.
    
- Expert system design is embedded in **Knowledge Management (KM)**, which intersects with:
    
    - **Information Management (IM)**
        
    - **Information Processing (IP)**
        
    - **Information Systems (IS)**
        
    - **Information Technology (IT)**
        

KM is vital due to the need to manage large, diverse, and growing information assets efficiently.

## üîπ 6.2 Selecting the Appropriate Problem

### ‚úÖ Key Questions Before Development

1. **Why build it?**
    
    - Needs a business case and management backing.
        
    - Avoid IP disputes; most workplace-generated ideas belong to the company.
        
2. **Who is the expert?**
    
    - Stick to **single expert per system** to avoid complexity.
        
    - Multi-expert systems require **blackboard architecture**.
        
3. **What is the payoff?**
    
    - ROI can be monetary, efficiency, or performance gains.
        
    - No use = No payoff.
        
4. **What tools should be used?**
    
    - Choose tools with proven success.
        
    - Understand **strong vs weak coupling**:
        
        - **Strong**: Rule A triggers Rule B (clear logic path).
            
        - **Weak**: Rule A enables multiple possible paths.
            
    - Tools like **CLIPS** and **Prot√©g√©** are common choices.
        
5. **How much will it cost?**
    
    - Hidden costs include:
        
        - Expert unavailability
            
        - Training
            
        - Maintenance (can be 10√ó development cost)
            
    - Use **public domain** or widely available knowledge to reduce cost.

## üîπ 6.3 Stages in Development

### üìå Three Major Management Areas:

1. **Activity Management**: Planning, milestones, scheduling.
    
2. **Product Configuration**: Version control, change tracking.
    
3. **Resource Management**: Acquire and manage expert availability and tools.
    

### üß≠ Project Development Strategy

- Align schedules with expert availability.
    
- Commercial world emphasizes **marketing pre-releases** over internal QA.
    
- Use automatic bug reporting and public betas to gather real-world feedback.
    

### üöö System Delivery

- Deployment considerations include:
    
    - Platform independence (e.g., Java‚Äôs ‚Äúwrite once, run anywhere‚Äù)
        
    - Integration with other programs (CLIPS can be called from C++)
        
    - Efficient communication between systems

## üîπ 6.4 Errors in Development

|**Error Type**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Expert Errors**|Inaccurate or outdated knowledge; panels and review boards (like NASA‚Äôs Flight Panels) can help|
|**Semantic Errors**|Misinterpretation of expert‚Äôs statements (e.g., ‚ÄúAll fires can be extinguished by water‚Äù)|
|**Syntax Errors**|Programming/formalization mistakes|
|**Inference Engine Errors**|Software bugs in pattern matching or conflict resolution|
|**Inference Chain Errors**|Incorrect priorities, rule conflicts, or propagation of uncertain/incomplete info|
|**Limits of Ignorance**|System may continue making poor conclusions unless explicitly told to stop|

üß† _Cognitive illusions_, perception bias, and **contextual misunderstandings** are common and must be accounted for during expert interviews.

---

## üîπ 6.5 Software Engineering & Expert Systems

- **Expert systems** must meet software quality standards‚Äîespecially for **mission-critical applications**.
    
- Must apply rigorous testing, especially when **human life or property is at stake**.
    

### üßÆ Software Quality Metrics (e.g., Table 6.1)

- Correctness
    
- Completeness
    
- Usability
    
- Robustness
    
- Maintainability
    
- Cost-effectiveness
    

üëâ _Testing must balance accuracy, cost, and scheduling._

---

## üîπ 6.6 The Expert System Life Cycle

### üí° Life Cycle = Continuous Process:

From **initial concept ‚Üí delivery ‚Üí maintenance ‚Üí retirement**

### üìà Maintenance

- More expensive than initial development
    
- Expert systems require **continuous updates** due to evolving knowledge
    
- Tools like **Prot√©g√©** and automated ontologies help, but systems grow in size and complexity
    

---

## üîÅ Life Cycle Models

### 1. **[[Waterfall Model]]**

- Linear, stage-by-stage
    
- Good for stability, but lacks flexibility
    
- Backtracking is costly
    

### 2. **[[Code-and-Fix]]**

- Undisciplined, mostly for **student projects or prototypes**
    

### 3. **[[Do-It-Twice]]**

- Build prototype first ‚Üí determine requirements ‚Üí build final system
    

### 4. **[[Incremental Model]]**

- Build in functional increments:
    
    - **Assistant ‚Üí Colleague ‚Üí Expert**
        
    - Easier to test, validate, refine
        

### 5. **[[Spiral Model]]**

- Incremental + iterative
    
- Each loop adds functionality
    
- New spiral begins with maintenance
    
## **6. Linear Model (Expert System Specific)**

### üìå Overview:

- A **structured model** for expert systems that includes stages like:
    
    - Planning
        
    - Knowledge Definition
        
    - Knowledge Design
        
    - Code & Checkout
        
    - Verification
        
    - Evaluation
        

### ‚úÖ Best For:

- Projects requiring a **methodical approach** with **iterative refinement**.
    
- Can be **repeated** across cycles for updates and evolution.

## üîπ 6.7 Detailed Life Cycle Model (Linear Model)

Follows sequence from **Planning ‚Üí Evaluation**, then repeats for future improvements.

### ‚úÖ Core Stages and Tasks

|**Stage**|**Key Tasks**|
|---|---|
|**Planning**|Feasibility, budgeting, scheduling (Table 6.2)|
|**Knowledge Definition**|Identify sources, acquire/analyze/extract (Tables 6.3, 6.4)|
|**Knowledge Design**|Define structure, detailed system blueprint (Tables 6.5, 6.6)|
|**Code & Checkout**|Implement code, test readiness (Table 6.7)|
|**Knowledge Verification**|Formal testing & result analysis (Tables 6.8, 6.9)|
|**System Evaluation**|Review performance, make recommendations (Table 6.10)|

---

## ‚úÖ Final Takeaways

- ‚úÖ **Expert systems development** must combine **AI principles** with **software engineering discipline**.
    
- ‚úÖ Carefully **select problems**, tools, and experts.
    
- ‚úÖ Plan for **uncertainty**, **rule conflicts**, and **maintenance** from the beginning.
    
- ‚úÖ Follow a structured **life cycle model** to ensure quality and adaptability.
    
- ‚úÖ Expert systems are never truly finished‚Äîthey **evolve with knowledge** and user needs.

## üí° Key Points

- **Problem Selection** is crucial. Avoid multi-expert modeling unless necessary.
    
- **Return on Investment (ROI)** must be clear: money, time, efficiency.
    
- **Tool Choice** must balance cost, usability, and long-term maintenance.
    
- **Semantic and Ontological structuring** are key to efficient rule-based systems.
    
- **Development Stages** must be planned using structured life cycle models (Waterfall, Incremental, Spiral).
    
- **Errors** occur at multiple levels:
    
    - Expert level (false knowledge)
        
    - Knowledge engineer (misinterpretation)
        
    - Tool bugs, rule interaction, syntax, semantics
        
- **Maintenance** is the most expensive phase and must be planned early.
    
- **Validation and verification** are vital at every step.
    
- **Use automated tools** for knowledge extraction and ontology construction (e.g., Prot√©g√©, CLIPS).
    
- **Expert Systems are iterative and evolve**‚Äîthey are never really "done."

## ‚ú® Summary
This chapter explains the **practical methodology for building real-world expert systems**, not just prototypes. It underscores the importance of applying **software engineering principles** to ensure high quality, cost-effective systems. The development begins with **problem selection**, goes through planning, knowledge acquisition, design, coding, testing, verification, and ends in evaluation.

The chapter introduces **life cycle models** such as the **Waterfall, Incremental, Spiral**, and the **Linear** model tailored to expert systems. Emphasis is placed on dealing with errors, planning for uncertainty, and handling the critical phase of **maintenance and evolution**. Real-world deployment issues and interoperability with other software systems are also discussed, with **CLIPS and Prot√©g√©** highlighted as key tools.
