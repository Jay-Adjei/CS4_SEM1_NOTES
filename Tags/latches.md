In **synchronous transmission**, the **receiver must read data at the right moment** to avoid errors. This is where **latching** comes in.

### **How "Latching" Works:**

- A **clock pulse** is sent along with the data.
- The **receiver waits** for each clock pulse.
- When a clock pulse arrives, the receiver **"latches" onto the data bit**, meaning it **captures and stores** the bit at that exact moment.
- The receiver does not check the data again until the next clock pulse arrives, ensuring **perfect timing**.

### **Why is Latching Important?**

- Prevents errors caused by slight timing mismatches.
- Ensures data is read at the same speed it is sent.
- Allows for **continuous and accurate data flow** without needing extra start/stop bits.

### **Example for Better Understanding:**

Think of a camera taking pictures:

- A camera (receiver) takes a picture (latches) **only when a timer (clock pulse) signals it**.
- This ensures each picture (data bit) is captured **at the right time** without missing or overlapping frames.

Similarly, in **synchronous transmission**, the **receiver "latches" onto each bit exactly when the clock pulse tells it to**, keeping everything in sync.
