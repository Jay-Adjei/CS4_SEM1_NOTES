"weight" refers to the numerical value that determines the strength and influence of the connection between two neurons.

Key Concepts of Weights in ANS:

1. Connection Strength:

Each connection between neurons has an associated weight. A higher weight means the input has a stronger influence on the neuron's activation, while a lower or negative weight reduces the influence.



2. Learning Process:

During the training phase, the system adjusts weights using algorithms like gradient descent and backpropagation. This process aims to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs.
