**Incremental development** is a method where a basic version of software is built, tested by users, and improved over multiple versions. Instead of planning everything upfront (like in the **Waterfall model**), development, testing, and feedback happen **simultaneously**, making changes easier and cheaper. This approach is commonly used in **Agile development** and works well for business, e-commerce, and personal applications.

#### **Key Benefits:**

✔️ **Easier to adapt to changing customer needs** – Less time spent redoing documentation.  
✔️ **Faster feedback from users** – Customers can test and suggest improvements early.  
✔️ **Quicker delivery** – Even if not fully complete, parts of the software can be used early.

#### **Challenges:**

❌ **Not always suited for large organizations** – Their strict procedures may not align with Agile methods.  
❌ **Difficult to track progress** – Managers rely on formal documentation, which Agile may lack.  
❌ **Software structure can degrade over time** – Without proper maintenance (refactoring), making changes becomes harder.

For **large, complex systems**, incremental development **needs a solid plan upfront**, especially when multiple teams are involved. Also, while software can be tested incrementally, **deploying** unfinished versions into real business environments may not always be practical.
