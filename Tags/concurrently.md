Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to perform multiple tasks or processes **at the same time** or to handle multiple tasks by quickly switching between them. It doesn't necessarily mean tasks are running simultaneously (that would be parallelism) but rather that they make progress independently within overlapping time periods.

### Key Characteristics of Concurrency:

1. **Overlap**: Different tasks or operations can progress in overlapping time frames.
2. **Resource Sharing**: Tasks might share common resources (like memory, CPU, or I/O devices) and coordinate access to them.
3. **Task Switching**: In single-core systems, concurrency is achieved by switching between tasks (e.g., multitasking in an operating system).

### Examples:

- In an operating system, multiple applications (e.g., a browser and a media player) appear to run at the same time, even if a single CPU is rapidly switching between them.
- A web server handles multiple client requests concurrently by processing one while waiting for input/output (I/O) from another.

Concurrency improves system performance and responsiveness by maximizing resource usage and reducing idle time.

#### Therefore:
"They operate concurrently" means that the CPU and the connected devices (like disks, mouse, keyboard, etc.) perform their tasks at the same time, rather than waiting for one to finish before the other begins.

For example:

- The CPU might be processing data while a disk controller is reading data from a disk.
- A printer might print a document while the CPU executes other instructions.

This simultaneous operation improves efficiency by allowing multiple components to work together without unnecessary delays, though they may need to coordinate access to shared resources like memory through mechanisms like the system bus.
