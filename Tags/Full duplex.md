-This transmission method involves only one core and goes in two ways.
-Involves two wavelengths, one for transmission and one for receiving.

### Advantages
- Faster communication since data flows in both directions at the same time.
- No waiting time, leading to lower latency and higher efficiency.
- Ideal for high-speed networks like internet backbones and data centers.

### Disadvantages
- Requires more complex hardware and cabling (e.g., separate fiber strands for sending and receiving).
- More expensive due to additional components.
