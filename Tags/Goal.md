To achieve a system's goal, the following must be understood:

1. **Central Objective**: The system must have a common goal. Without it, components lose coordination and work in different directions.
2. **Integration**: All components must work together in harmony, ensuring coordination to achieve the system's goal.
3. **Synergistic Effect**: The system should function as a unified whole, where the combined effort of components creates a greater effect than the sum of individual parts. This is called the synergistic effect.
