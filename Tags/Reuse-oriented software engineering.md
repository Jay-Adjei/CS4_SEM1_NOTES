Most software projects **reuse existing code or designs** to save time and effort. This can happen **informally** (developers modifying old code) or **formally** through **reuse-oriented development**, where software is built using **pre-existing components** instead of developing everything from scratch.

### **Key Steps in Reuse-Oriented Development:**

1️⃣**Component Analysis** – Searching for existing software components that match the project needs.  
2️⃣ **Requirements Modification** – Adjusting project requirements to fit available components.  
3️⃣ **System Design with Reuse** – Creating a system framework that incorporates these components.  
4️⃣ **Development & Integration** – Building missing parts and integrating all components.

### **Types of Reusable Components:**

- 🌐 **Web services** – Online services that can be accessed remotely.
- 📦 **Component libraries** – Pre-built object collections (e.g., .NET, J2EE frameworks).
- 🖥 **Standalone software** – Full applications configured for specific use.

### **Pros & Cons of Software Reuse**

✅ **Advantages:**  
✔ Less development work, reducing **costs and risks**.  
✔ **Faster delivery** since much of the system is pre-built.

❌ **Challenges:**  
✖ **Compromised requirements** – The system may not fully meet user needs.  
✖ **Loss of control** – Updates to reused components depend on external providers.

Software reuse is **a key part of modern development**, helping to speed up projects but requiring trade-offs. 🚀
