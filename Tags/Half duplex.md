-Involves two fibres, one for transmission and the other for receiving.

### Advantages
- Simpler and cheaper, as it can use a single fiber for both sending and receiving (alternating).
- Suitable for applications where simultaneous transmission isn't needed (e.g., some sensor networks).

### Disadvantages
- Slower because devices must take turns to send data.
- Higher latency, which can affect real-time applications like video calls
