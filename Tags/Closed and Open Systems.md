    - Do not interact with their environment.
    - Have controlled and well-defined inputs and outputs.
    - Example: A television that adjusts brightness and sharpness using sensors.
- **Open Systems**:
    
    - Interact with their environment by exchanging materials, manpower, money, and information.
    - Example: A business organization system.
