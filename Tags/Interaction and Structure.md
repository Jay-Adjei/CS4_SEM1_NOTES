- A key feature of a system is the interaction between its components.
- A system is not just a group of elements; its components must work together. For example, in an organization, departments like purchasing, production, and inventory interact and depend on each other.
- This interaction makes the system dynamic.
- The relationships between components define the systemâ€™s **structure**, which separates it from its environment.
