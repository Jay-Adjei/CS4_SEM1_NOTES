### Definition
**Interrupts** are signals sent to the CPU by hardware or software to indicate that a task or event needs immediate attention. They temporarily halt the CPU's current execution to allow it to handle the event, then resume normal processing.

### Key Features of Interrupts:

1. **Purpose**: They enable efficient communication between devices and the CPU without constant polling.
2. **Types**:
    - **Hardware Interrupts**: Generated by devices like keyboards, printers, or disk drives (e.g., a keypress or completion of an I/O operation).
    - **Software Interrupts**: Triggered by programs, such as system calls or errors (e.g., division by zero).
3. **Process**:
    - An interrupt signal is sent to the CPU.
    - The CPU pauses its current task and executes an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** to handle the interrupt.
    - Once completed, the CPU resumes its original task.

### Example:

When a printer finishes printing a document, it sends an interrupt to notify the CPU that the printing task is complete and is ready for the next task.

### Common Functions of Interrupts:

1. **Control Transfer**: Interrupts transfer control to the **[[Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)]]** using an **interrupt vector** (a table containing addresses of ISRs).
2. **Address Saving**: The interrupt mechanism saves the address of the interrupted instruction to resume execution later.
3. **Software Interrupts**:
    - **Trap/Exception**: A software-generated interrupt caused by an error or a user request.
4. **Interrupt-Driven OS**: Operating systems rely on interrupts to manage and respond to events efficiently.
