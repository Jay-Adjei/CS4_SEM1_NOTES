### Definition:

**Multiplexing** is the process of **transmitting multiple signals** (digital or analog) **over one shared communication medium** or channel by separating them in time, frequency, or code.

---

### Purpose:

- Efficient use of **bandwidth**
    
- **Reduce cost** of physical infrastructure
    
- Enable **simultaneous communication**
    

---

### Types of Multiplexing:

1. **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):**
    
    - Each signal is assigned a **different frequency band**.
        
    - Used in **radio, TV broadcasting**, and analog telephone networks.
        
2. **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):**
    
    - Each signal is given a **specific time slot** in a repeating sequence.
        
    - Common in **digital communication systems**.
        
3. **Code Division Multiplexing (CDM):**
    
    - Each signal is encoded with a unique **code** and sent over the same channel.
        
    - Used in **cellular networks (e.g., CDMA)**.

### Final Takeaways:

✔ Multiplexing allows **multiple signals to share a single channel**.  
✔ It increases **efficiency** and **reduces transmission cost**.  
✔ Major types include **FDM**, **TDM**, and **CDM**, each suitable for different technologies and scenarios.
