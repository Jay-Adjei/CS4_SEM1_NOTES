The **Doppler Shift** (or **Doppler Effect**) is the **change in frequency or wavelength** of a wave **in relation to an observer** who is moving relative to the wave source.

### In Data Communication (e.g., Satellite Communication):

- It occurs when a satellite **moves toward or away** from a receiving station.
    
- This movement **alters the frequency** of the signal received.
    

---

### Example:

- If a satellite is moving **toward** Earth, the signal’s frequency appears **higher**.
    
- If it's moving **away**, the frequency appears **lower**.

### Why It Matters:

✔ Affects **carrier frequency** during transmission.  
✔ Can cause **errors in data reception** if not corrected.  
✔ Important in **GPS, satellite links**, and **radar systems**.
