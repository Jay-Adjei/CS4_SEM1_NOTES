External circuits are **separate hardware devices** that handle **encryption and decryption** without being permanently built into a computer or communication system. These circuits allow **secure, portable encryption** that can be easily moved between different devices or locations.

### **Why Use External Encryption Circuits?**

1. **Portability** – Can be carried and used on different devices (e.g., laptops, servers).
2. **Security** – Keeps encryption separate from the main system, reducing risks of hacking.
3. **Flexibility** – Can be used with different devices, including older systems that don’t have built-in encryption.
4. **Hardware-Based Security** – Provides stronger encryption than software-only methods.

### **Examples of External Encryption Circuits**

✅ **USB Encryption Dongles:**

- Small USB devices that encrypt and decrypt data when plugged in.
- Used in secure communications, banking, and government systems.

✅ **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):**

- External devices used by banks and cloud services for **strong encryption key management**.
- Used in **credit card transactions, secure emails, and cloud encryption**.

✅ **Portable Encryption Chips:**

- Small encryption processors built into **external drives** or **portable devices**.
- Protects stored data (e.g., **encrypted hard drives and SSDs**).
