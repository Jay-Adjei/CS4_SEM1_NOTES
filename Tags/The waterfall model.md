-Because of the cascade from one phase to another, this model is known as the ‘waterfall model’ or software life cycle.

-The waterfall model is an example of a plan-driven process—in principle, you must plan and schedule all of the process activities before starting work on them.

The principal stages of the waterfall model directly reflect the fundamental development activities:
- **Requirements analysis and definition:** Define what the system should do by consulting with users to establish services, constraints, and goals. This serves as the system's specification.
    
- **System and software design:** Plan how the system will work by allocating requirements to hardware or software. Identify key software components and their relationships.
    
- **Implementation and unit testing:** Create the software programs and test each unit to ensure they meet the specifications.
    
- **Integration and system testing:** Combine and test all the programs as a whole system to make sure it meets the requirements. After testing, deliver the software to the customer.
    
- **Operation and maintenance:** Install and use the system. Fix any errors, improve the system, and enhance its services based on new requirements.

Software development follows **phases**, but in practice, these **overlap and influence each other**. Issues in requirements, design, and coding lead to **feedback loops**, requiring document revisions. Since frequent iterations are costly, parts of the system are often **frozen prematurely**, causing **design flaws and unmet user needs**.

The **Waterfall Model** provides a **structured, document-heavy approach**, making project tracking easier. However, its **rigid phases** make adapting to **changing requirements difficult**. It works best when **requirements are stable**.

A **formal variant** of Waterfall uses **mathematical models** to ensure **system reliability**, mainly for **safety-critical industries**. However, it is complex, costly, and rarely used for general software projects.
