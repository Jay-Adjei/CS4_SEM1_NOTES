- **Deterministic Systems**:
    
    - Operate predictably, with interactions among components fully known.
    - The system's future state can be determined exactly based on its current state.
    - Example: Computer systems.
- **Probabilistic Systems**:
    
    - Operate with some uncertainty, and predictions about behavior involve probabilities.
    - A degree of error is always present in forecasting system behavior.
    - Examples: Inventory replenishment systems, weather forecasting systems.
