Spooling is a method of managing I/O by using a buffer to queue jobs for a slower device (like a printer). While one job is processed, others are prepared in the queue, allowing the system to overlap tasks and work more efficiently.
#### **Advantages of Spooling**:

- Improves system performance by allowing multitasking.
- Prevents slower devices from delaying faster processes.
- Ensures orderly processing of jobs (e.g., printing jobs in order).
