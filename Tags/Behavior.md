- **Behavior** is how a system reacts to its environment.
- It is influenced by procedures designed to ensure components act to achieve the system's goals.
- Example: Touching something hot triggers the nervous system to withdraw the body.
    - Heat is the input.
    - Reaction (withdrawal) is the behavior.
    - Instructions from the nervous system are the procedure.
- **Procedures** define what should happen, while **behavior** shows what actually happens.
